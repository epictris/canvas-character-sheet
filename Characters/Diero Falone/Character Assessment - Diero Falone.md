Diero fled Turmish with nothing but the clothes on his back, and a deeply rooted hatred of orcs. He quickly discovered that most of the world treats tieflings with suspicion and fear, and he learned to hide his skin and face. Since then he has been travelling Toril learning what he can to develop his skills in combat. One day he vows to return to the Orsraun Mountains to seek vengeance on the orcs who devastated his home. In his travels, Diero heard tales of an ancient deity known as Tharizdun. By studying ancient manuscripts, Diero found he was able to draw magical power from some connection with this deity, and he wants to learn as much as he can about this mysterious affinity.
