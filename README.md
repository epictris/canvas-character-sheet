# Obsidian Canvas Character Sheet

This vault contains the assets, canvas, fonts and CSS snippet required to use the DnD character sheet I created using [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas).

The .canvas file is located at */Characters/Diero Falone/Canvas - Diero Falone*

**PLEASE NOTE:**
- The snippet contains CSS that targets all canvases. If you choose to add this to your own vault, you will likely want to disable the snippet to use your own personal canvases normally.
- Some elements have had their resizing/movement disabled for UX purposes. If you want to resize/rearrange the elements yourself, the CSS controlling that is at the top of the *canvas_styling.css* file.
